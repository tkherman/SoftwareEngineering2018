I spent most of the time designing the class diagram and really thinking through what to represent the game objects.
Currently, my design involves having an abstract GameObj class and an abstract GameObjView class. Any object that isn't
chip will inherit from the above which makes it easier for the gameMapBuilder class to keep track of the grid.
I decided to have Chip class to not inherit from the two abstract class because it reacts to user input and I am
planning on making it an Observable while having a ChipView class observing it so to isolate the logic of Chip's
image rotating.

After spending the time on design, I started creating the skeleton classes. I also created the basic javaFx application
that currently simply reacts to user pressing ESC and it would escape the application.
