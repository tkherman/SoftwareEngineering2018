My program consist of 4 main classes: OceanExplorer, OceanMap, ColumbusShip and PirateShip.

OceanExplorer handles all the GUI rendering as it contains all the views and nodes necessary while OceanMap handles initilizing the grid. Once OceanMap intilizes the grid, it is used by ColumbusShip and PirateShip to determine if a grid is Ocean or Island. The locations of ColumbusShip and PirateShips are contained within the classes respectively and not in the OceanMap. I chose to do this because to implement the Observer pattern, having to keep track of the locations in OceanMap as well would be more error prone since I would have to update the local variables within the Ships as well as the grid in OceanMap.

I like this design because it was simple to implement and the logic for the ColumbusShip movement and PirateShips movement are separated into their own classes. However, if I were to extend the design to support a reset button and images for ocean and island, there are a few things that I would change. I would add a grid Node[][] in OceanExplorer that keeps track of each Node that represents the ocean/island. This way, I have reference to each grid's image and I can remove and delete them as I need. When calling the drawMap() function in OceanExplorer, I can handle add the Images while adding the Nodes/ImageViews to the grid. Since I have reference to all the Nodes/ImageViews, I could easily add a button that reset the location of the island/ocean as well as the ships.
